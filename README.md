ü©∫ Symptom Checker PrototypeProject Title: Medical Symptom Checker PrototypeOverviewThis project is a client-side web application prototype designed for a final academic project. Its primary function is to demonstrate a working concept of a symptom-to-specialist advisory tool. Users can input a list of symptoms, and the application's internal JavaScript data model analyzes the input, associates it with potential conditions, and recommends the appropriate medical specialist.Key Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer (Required for Project)THIS PROTOTYPE IS NOT A REAL MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.It is built solely for educational and demonstration purposes. The information provided is based on a limited, simplified dataset and matching logic. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users should always consult a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns.üöÄ Getting StartedSince this is a client-side application (no backend server required), setup is extremely simple.PrerequisitesYou only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).Installation and SetupDownload/Clone: Download all three project files (index.html, script.js, style.css) into a single folder on your computer.Run: Double-click the index.html file. It will automatically open in your default web browser.‚ú® FeaturesThe prototype includes the following functional features:Flexible Symptom Input: Users input symptoms into a text area, separated by commas.Intelligent Matching Algorithm: The JavaScript logic compares the user's input against the stored disease dataset. It uses a partial match system (e.g., "headache" can match "severe headache") for better usability.Ranked Results: Potential diseases are displayed, ranked by the highest number of matching symptoms found.Specialist Recommendation: Each potential condition comes with a clear recommendation for the appropriate medical specialist (e.g., Neurologist, Dermatologist, GP).Professional UI: A clean, responsive user interface built with custom CSS, featuring prominent design elements for the required disclaimer and results.Mock Call-to-Action: A dedicated button leading to a "Mock Directory" to complete the user journey simulation.üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure and Logic1. index.htmlContains the overall layout, the symptom input <textarea>, the "Check Symptoms" button, and the dedicated <div id="output"> where results are injected.Includes the required Disclaimer prominently at the top.2. script.jsThis is the core functional file.ComponentDescriptionmedicalData ArrayThe hardcoded JSON-like data model containing $\approx 10$ diseases, a list of associated symptoms, and the required specialist for each.checkSymptoms() FunctionCore logic: This function handles input cleanup, runs the matching algorithm against the medicalData, sorts the results by the number of matches, and dynamically generates the result cards into the HTML.Matching LogicUses the .includes() method to check if the user's input symptom is contained within any of the disease's official symptom strings, making the search forgiving.3. style.cssProvides professional, clean styling.Uses distinct color coding for Disclaimer (yellow/orange warning) and Result Cards (light blue for medical/information).üß™ Testing the PrototypeTo demonstrate the application's effectiveness, try these test cases:Symptoms InputExpected Top ResultSpecialist Recommendationstomach pain, diarrhea, vomitingGastroenteritisGastroenterologistredness, itching, rashDermatitisDermatologistswelling, joint pain, stiffnessArthritisRheumatologistsore throat, feverTonsillitis or Common ColdENT or GP‚úçÔ∏è AuthorFlorence Mbithe
